# FetchNow

![A lousy icon for this program, depicting a flying email](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magneticdud/FetchNow/refs/heads/main/icon.jpg)

A module for freescout that adds a "Fetch now" button for all users

## How to use

**As of now there is no public facing button**, just go to yourfreescoutURL.com/fetch-emails to fetch the latest 3 days, including read emails. If i have time I will add more features.
